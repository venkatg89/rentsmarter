pod update RCT-Folly --no-repo-update

then change boost podspec to point at my 176.0 repo

@itinance yes you can easily "fork" a podspec. Copy the podspec over from the master repo, download the source manually, change the source in the copied podspec and re-publish it to your own cocoapods repo.

Then use pod 'Boost', :source => 'your-own-repo.git'.

Going to close this issue. Please message here if you feel strongly there is something we can improve in CocoaPods library itself.

Alternatively, you can ask the author to update their source.

boost is here

https://boostorg.jfrog.io/ui/native/main/release/1.76.0/source

created github repo with source:
https://github.com/misbell/boost-176.0.git

====
Pod::Spec.new do |spec|
  spec.name = 'boost'
  spec.version = '1.76.0'
  spec.license = { :type => 'Boost Software License', :file => "LICENSE_1_0.txt" }
  spec.homepage = 'http://www.boost.org'
  spec.summary = 'Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries.'
  spec.authors = 'Rene Rivera'
  spec.source = { :http => 'https://github.com/misbell/boost-176.0.git' }

  # Pinning to the same version as React.podspec.
  spec.platforms = { :ios => '12.0', :tvos => '12.0' }
  spec.requires_arc = false

  spec.module_name = 'boost'
  spec.header_dir = 'boost'
  spec.preserve_path = 'boost'
end

  spec.preserve_path = 'boost'
end



the podspec is in:
../RentSmarter/node_modules/react-native/third-party-podspecs


====
boost will finish with pod install now

====
then to prevent compile error

//typedef enum clockid_t;
extern "C" int clock_gettime(clockid_t clk_id, struct timespec* ts);
extern "C" int clock_getres(clockid_t clk_id, struct timespec* ts);
#endif

comment out this typedef in time.h in rtc folly in 
../Pods/RCT-Folly/folly/portability

that will get rid of that error
finally an error because a libarary isn't installed...

=====
Figured this out. There is a new library in Xcode 12 that needs to be added 
to the Link Binary with Libraries phase call 

libSwiftWebKit.tbd. 

Error went away after adding this.
