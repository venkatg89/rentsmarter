expenses on main calc
NEVER change the initial Oex

positive move

get total moved on main slider

say its 80

divide by 8, that's the part

set the context oex to initial + part


======what is state used for========

**on expenses component in Main  
-captures init value of expenses
-captures init value of each itemized expense
(since never changed, why? why not just use context or redux)

--in both cases init once on slider start 

**on itemized expenses
-captures init value of each itemized expense
--init once on slider start 

======what is context used for========

**on main
-update context for each itemized exp, so it's reflected there, 
-also -the source of current value of each itemized expense

**on itemized expenses
-the 'state at calculator level' for each itemized expense.

what is redux used for
