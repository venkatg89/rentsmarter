          Fannie Mae respects your concerns about privacy and values its
          relationship with you. This Online Privacy Notice describes the types
          of personal information we may collect about you or that you may
          provide when you visit or interact with our websites and applications
          that link to this Privacy Notice (our "Sites"), and our practices for
          collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that
          information. We also describe the measures we take to protect the
          security of the information and how you can contact us about our
          privacy practices.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}
          In addition, this Privacy Notice applies to information we collect:
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}
          From third parties;
          {"\n"}
          In email, text, and other electronic messages between you and these
          Sites; and
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}
          When you interact with our advertising and applications on third-party
          websites and services, but only if those applications or advertising
          include links to this Privacy Notice. It does not apply to information
          collected by:
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}
          Us offline or through any other means (except as explicitly noted); or
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}
          Any third party for its own purposes, including through any
          application or content (including advertising) that may link to or be
          accessible from or on the Sites. Information We Collect
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}
          Information You Provide. We may obtain certain personal information
          (such as name and other contact details) through our Sites. Here are
          the most common types of information:
          {"\n"}

          {"\n"}
          This information is actively provided to us by you on a voluntary
          basis. We oﬀer visitors to our Sites various services, which we may
          change from time to time. We may ask you to submit certain personal
          information so we can provide you with these services.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}
          Information Collected Automatically.{"\n"}
          {"\n"} When you visit our Sites, we and our third-party service
          providers collect information through automated technologies such as
          cookies, web server logs, and web beacons. We and our third-party
          service providers may combine and enhance this information with the
          personal information that we collect about you directly or from third
          parties. The information collected using these technologies may
          include your IP address, device ID, browser characteristics, operating
          system, the address of the web page that referred you to our Site,
          dates and times of Site visits, the language your system uses, and the
          country and time zone in which your device is located. These
          technologies permit the collection of "clickstream data," which may
          include a log of content you access while browsing a website.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}
          Cookies and Web Beacons.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"} A "cookie" is a file that Web sites send to a visitor's
          computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the
          visitor's browser or to store information or settings in the browser.
          Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Sites,
          while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us
          to track your activities at our Sites. In some cases, we may ask for
          your agreement before placing cookies on your browser for certain
          purposes. A "web beacon," also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag, or
          clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be
          used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web
          server.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}
          Disabling Cookies. {"\n"}
          {"\n"}Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you
          prefer, your browser may give you options to delete cookies or to
          block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most
          browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new
          cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new
          cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}
          Visitors to our Sites who disable cookies will be able to browse
          certain areas of the Sites, but some features may not function.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}
          Information Collected from Third Parties.{"\n"}
          {"\n"} We may combine personal information that you provide to us or
          we collect automatically with information we receive about you from
          third parties.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}
          Third-Party Analytics. {"\n"}
          {"\n"}On our Sites we use third-party web analytics services, such as
          Google Analytics. These services may rely upon technologies such as
          cookies, web server logs and web beacons to help us analyze how
          visitors reach and interact with our Sites. The information collected
          through these means (including IP address) is disclosed to or
          collected directly by these service providers and may be combined with
          other information that they collect across unrelated websites and apps
          over time. In Google Analytics, we have enabled “Demographics and
          Interest Reports,” a Google Analytics Advertising Feature which
          collects data about web traﬀic via Google Advertising Cookies that
          were previously placed on your web browser. This Analytics Advertising
          Feature allows Google to give us aggregated information concerning
          visitor demographics, such as age and gender, along with information
          related to the interests visitors express through their online
          browsing and purchasing activities. If your Google account settings
          permit Google to use the information Google has collected about you to
          personalize advertisements, Google Analytics will use this information
          to identify other devices you use for advertising purposes. Please see
          the Cross Device Linking section and Third-party ad services section
          below for more information about these activities and the choices
          available to you. To opt out of Google Analytics, click here. To learn
          more about Google's additional collection and analysis of information
          by automated means, including how to opt out, click here.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}
          Cross Device Linking. {"\n"}
          {"\n"}We and our third party service providers may use the information
          that we collect about you (whether directly from you from our Sites,
          through your device(s), or from a third party) to help us and our
          third-party service providers identify other devices that you use
          (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, other computer, etc.). This is called
          cross-device linking. We and our third-party service providers also
          may use cross-device linking and other information we learn about you
          to serve targeted advertising on your devices and to send you emails.
          To opt out of cross-device linking for interest-based advertising
          purposes, you may follow the instructions set forth in the Third-Party
          Ad Services section below.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}
          Third-Party Ad Services.{"\n"}
          {"\n"} We also use third parties such as network advertisers to
          promote our Sites on third-party websites or other media (e.g., social
          networking platforms) based on information that these third parties
          collect about your activities on our Sites and unrelated websites and
          apps over time. This activity, called "interest-based advertising,"
          enables us and these third parties to target advertisements to you for
          products and services in which you might be interested and learn more
          about our visitors' online activities. These third-party ad services
          may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons, Flash LSOs and other
          tracking technologies to measure the eﬀectiveness of their ads and to
          personalize advertising content to you. Their activities and
          technologies are governed by each third party's specific privacy
          policy, not this one.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}
          Users in the United States may opt out of many third-party ad
          services’ collection and use of data for interest-based advertising.
          For example you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”)
          WebChoices Page for information about opting out of interest-based
          advertising by companies participating in the Digital Advertising
          Initiative. You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative
          (“NAI”) Consumer Opt-Out Page for information about opting out of
          interest-based advertising by NAI members. Opting out from one or more
          companies listed on the DAA Consumer Choice Page or the NAI Consumer
          Opt-Out Page will opt you out from those companies' delivery of
          interest-based ads to you on the device where you exercise choice, but
          it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising. You may
          continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the
          particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based
          ads). Please note: if you opt out of these targeted advertising
          cookies, your opt out will be specific to the web browser or mobile
          device from which you accessed the opt out. If you use multiple
          devices or browsers, you will need to opt out each browser or device
          that you use. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies
          when you opt out on the DAA or NAI websites or if you later delete
          cookies, your opt out may not be eﬀective. Additional information is
          available on the DAA's website at www.aboutads.info or the NAI’s
          website at www.networkadvertising.org.

          Do-Not-Track
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}
          We do not currently respond to "do not track" signals sent by your
          browser or other mechanism.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}
          How We Use the Information We Collect
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}
          We may use the information we collect for our business purposes, such
          as to:
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}
          Verify your identity and maintain the security of the Sites and our
          business;
          {"\n"}

          services, and events;
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}Create, administer and communicate with you about your online
          account or subscription;

          applications;
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}Provide and administer communications tools available through
          our sites, such as tools for submitting online oﬀers to purchase homes
          owned by Fannie Mae;
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}Operate, evaluate and improve our business (including developing
          new products and services; managing our communications; performing
          market research; managing our advertising and marketing; analyzing our
          products, services, and Sites; administering our Sites; and performing
          accounting, auditing, billing, reconciliation and collection
          activities);
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}Protect against and prevent fraud, unauthorized activity, claims
          and other liabilities; or

          standards and our policies and terms of use.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}The information collected may be processed by us to draw
          inferences about your characteristics and preferences. We may infer
          your general geolocation based on the collected device ID or IP
          address. We also may use the information in other ways and, if
          required, will also provide specific notice at the time of collection
          or use.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}
          Sharing of Personal Information
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}
          We may share personal information we collect on our Sites as described
          here.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}
          We may share the information with our service providers who perform
          services on our behalf. For example, we may provide personal
          information to third parties such as technology providers to enable
          such third parties to perform business, professional and technical
          support functions for us, our Sites or for you.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}On certain Sites, we provide tools to allow real estate agents
          to communicate with each other to negotiate transactions. In the
          course of these communications, they may use our tools to share
          personal information about the parties they represent.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}We reserve the right to transfer personal information we have
          about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our
          business or assets. Should such an event occur, we will use reasonable
          eﬀorts to direct the transferee to use personal information you have
          provided to us on our Sites in a manner that is consistent with this
          Online Privacy Notice.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}In addition, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are
          required to do so by law or legal process (such as a court order),
          (ii) in response to a request by law enforcement authorities or
          regulatory agencies, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary
          or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in
          connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal
          activity.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}Our Sites include features that allow you to participate in
          public forums or interact with other users. When you participate in
          these features, the information that you provide will be available to
          other Site users and/or the general public.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}We may disclose de-identified or aggregated information in our
          discretion.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}Your Choices
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}We oﬀer you certain choices about how we communicate with you
          and what information we collect from you. Some of our Sites provide
          features that allow you to (i) access and update personal information
          you have provided there or (ii) register your communications
          preferences, such as by telling us not to send you marketing
          materials. If you wish to opt out of receiving our marketing emails,
          you can follow the directions contained in any marketing email that we
          send to you. You also may contact us as described in the How To
          Contact Us section below to update your preferences, ask us to remove
          your information from our mailing lists or submit other requests. Even
          if you opt out of marketing emails, we will continue to send you email
          messages related to our transactions or relationship with you.
          Business contacts may be required to receive certain information in
          the course of doing business with Fannie Mae.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}How We Protect Personal Information
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}We maintain reasonable administrative, technical and physical
          safeguards designed to protect the personal information we collect on
          our Sites against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction,
          loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}Links to Other Web Sites, Features, and Embedded Content
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}For your convenience and information, our Sites may provide
          links to other Web sites or online services, including social media
          sites, or present content or features from other Web sites or other
          third parties. These Web sites may operate independently from Fannie
          Mae. The Web sites may have their own privacy notices or policies,
          which we strongly suggest you review if you visit any linked Web site
          or pages containing content hosted by other Web sites. To the extent
          such Web sites are not owned or controlled by Fannie Mae, we are not
          responsible for the Web site's content, any use of the Web site, or
          the privacy practices of the Web site.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}The Sites may also include integrated social media tools or
          "plug-ins," such as social networking tools oﬀered by third parties.
          If you use these tools to share personal information or you otherwise
          interact with social media features on the Sites, those social media
          companies may collect information about you and may use and share such
          information in accordance with your account settings, including by
          sharing such information with the general public.

          {"\n"}Website Visitors and Investors from Outside of the U.S.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}The privacy laws of other countries outside of the U.S. may
          provide rights for natural persons who are considered data subjects
          under such laws. The European Union’s General Data Protection
          Regulation (GDPR) is an example of such a law. This Privacy Notice
          provides such data subjects with information about the data we collect
          and how that data is processed. In accordance with your rights as a
          data subject, you may request information about how we collect, use,
          share, store and retain your personal information. Among other rights
          as a data subject, you may obtain rectification of errors in the
          record of your personal data, or you may request a copy or erasure of
          your personal data. These rights are subject to our right to process
          your personal data based on your consent, as necessary for the
          performance of a contract to which you are party, a legal obligation
          to which Fannie Mae is subject, or Fannie Mae’s legitimate interests.

          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}Your Rights and Choices
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}The CCPA provides California consumers with specific rights
          regarding their personal information. This section describes your CCPA
          rights and explains how to exercise those rights.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}Access to Specific Information
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}California consumers may, upon a verifiable consumer request,
          ask that we disclose certain information to you about our collection
          and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we
          receive and confirm your request, we will disclose to you (depending
          on your request):
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}The categories of personal information that we collected, used,
          or disclosed about you:
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}The categories of sources for the personal information that we
          collected about you;
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}The business or commercial purpose for collecting the personal
          information;
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}The categories of third parties with whom the personal
          information was shared; and
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}The specific pieces of personal information we collected about
          you.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}Deletion Request Rights
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}You have the right to request that we delete personal
          information that we collected from you, subject to certain exceptions.
          Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will
          delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal
          information from our records, unless an exception applies.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}Exercising Access and Deletion Rights
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}To exercise the access and deletion rights described above,
          please submit a verifiable consumer request here, or contact us at
          this toll-free telephone number, 1-888-FM-ETHICS (1-888-363-8442). We
          will require that you provide proof of your identity in the form of
          your name and email address so that we can confirm your identity. We
          may email you separately using the email address provided or a
          previous email address if we have such information to confirm your
          identity. We cannot carry out your request or provide you with
          personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to
          make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.
          We will use the personal information provided in a verifiable consumer
          request only to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make
          the request.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}The CCPA also allows you to designate an authorized agent to
          make a request for personal information on your behalf. In order to
          designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, you
          must provide the agent with signed permission to do so and provide
          proof of your identity, or the agent must have a valid power of
          attorney. An authorized agent can make a verifiable consumer request
          on your behalf through one of the submission methods noted above. In
          order for us to process the request, the authorized agent will be
          required to provide evidence of signed permission and your e-mail
          address to verify your identity, or proof of valid power of attorney.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to
          direct a business to not sell your personal information at any time.
          We do not sell your personal information. Further, we do not sell the
          personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 16
          years of age.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}Non-Discrimination and Financial Incentives
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}We will not discriminate against you for exercising your CCPA
          rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}Deny you goods or services.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}Charge you diﬀerent prices or rates for goods or services,
          including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing
          penalties.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}Provide you a diﬀerent level or quality of goods or services.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}Suggest that you may receive a diﬀerent price or rate for goods
          or services or a diﬀerent level or quality of goods or services.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}However, we may oﬀer you certain financial incentives permitted
          by CCPA that can result in diﬀerent prices, rates, or quality levels.
          Such financial incentives will be described in separate notices. Any
          financial incentive we oﬀer will reasonably relate to your personal
          information’s value and contain written terms that describe the
          program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive
          program requires your prior opt-in consent, which you may revoke at
          any time.
