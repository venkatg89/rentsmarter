if the emulator isn't working

shutdown restart
kill terminal and restart
sign into vpn without signing into zscaler first (log out of vpn, log in again)
try changing 8082 to 8082 in merger.xml (even though something changes it back automatically)
try deleting $TMPDIR (-rf *.* and -rf *)
wipe data from emulator
run abd in $HOME/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools
yarn start --reset-cache
see if something else is using port 8082



however, it seems that sometimes it just stops working

the problem is that emulator under certain conditions cannot connect to metro on 8082
we don't know what those conditions are.
maybe a scan of some kind could tell us.
